*ICEpdf Issue Reporting 

Issues are created to help identify and define a bug, improvement or a new feature.  The issue tracking system is designed to
track one specific subject, so please don’t overfill a single issue, create another one to keep the ratio 1:1.  There is an 
old saying “you get more with honey than vinegar”, please be as friendly and constructive as possible when creating a new 
issue.    

Issues that are related to the rendering of a single PDF files almost always need a sample file to be submitted with the 
issue.  There are a few exceptions were logging can shed light on the issue but to iterate we almost always need the file 
question to solve the issue.   But if you have a nice logging exception make sure to include it too.  

Please be careful when uploading a PDF file to the issue tracker with sensitive information.  Many PDF files have financial 
or patient health information so please, pretty please, double pretty please, make sure you are not uploading anything the 
internet that cannot be remember forever.  

Lastly make sure to search existing issues before creating a new issue and make sure to read to Wiki for more information on 
getting started and the many different ways to configure the library.
